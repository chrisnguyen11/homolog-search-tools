# homolog-search-tools

Python-based module to search protein databases for homologs, visualize search results, and perfrom sequence-based analysis for downstream applications. 
 
Use cases:
- Heterologous gene expression: gather aminno acid sequences (of genes) that carry out a heterologous reaction of interest, visualize sequence space, and identify candiate genes for heterologous expression. 
- Explore gene sequence space:
